In the beginning, there was darkness and emptiness and a man named Tim Berners-Lee said "Let there be internet".

The internet was a simpler in those days, with just HTML content arranged on the page as you would in a word document. But within the next couple of years people got sick of looking at Times New Roman and so then Tim said "let the fonts and colours and sizes and positions be changeable". And then there was CSS.

But this still wasn't good enough and so not long after that, people discovered you could use tables for layouts. This was great because you could break the webpage up into a grid, merge cells where needed and embed tables inside tables to give you better control about how your content was laid out on the page.
